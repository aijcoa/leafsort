# How to build

```sh
# clone this repo
$ git clone https://github.com/sprout2000/leafview.git

# install dependencies and build
$ cd leafview
$ npm install && npm run package
```

And then you will find the installer in the `release` directory.

_NOTE: You will need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [Git](https://git-scm.com/) installed._
