# :hammer_and_wrench: How to build LeafView

```sh
# clone this repo.
$ git clone https://github.com/sprout2000/leafview.git

# install dependencies
$ cd leafview
$ npm install

# build LeafView
$ npm run build && npm run package
```

And then you will find the installer in the `release` directory.

_NOTE: You will need to have [Git](https://git-scm.com/) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed._
