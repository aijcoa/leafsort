### Integrating AppImages into the desktop

Although AppImage is not bundled to be _installed_, You can also integrate it into your desktop environment by using [AppImageLauncher](https://github.com/TheAssassin/AppImageLauncher).

After install AppImageLauncher, you can simply double-click AppImages. You will be prompted whether to integrate the AppImage, or run it just once.

When you choose to integrate your AppImage, the file will be moved into the directory **`~/Applications`**. This helps reducing the mess of AppImages on your file system.
